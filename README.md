Udemy Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Project Overview

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Udemy dataset to uncover insights about courses, subjects, and subscriber trends. Using Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn, I analyzed the dataset to answer questions such as:

    What is the distribution of courses by subject?
    Which subject is the most popular?
    What are the trends in subscriber counts?

Dataset Details

        The course with the highest subscribers
        Average number of subscribers per course
        Total subscribers across all courses

    Missing Data:
        Checked and confirmed missing values.
    Deal with the date time column

Visualizations

    Course Distribution by Subject:
        Bar Chart: Visualized the number of courses for each subject.
        Pie Chart: Showed the proportion of courses per subject.

    Subscriber Distribution:
        Identified and visualized trends in subscriber counts.

Tools and Libraries Used
